# ECGProj

ECG is fundamentally very simple in concept. I was given literal boxes of expired ECG stickers by a friend who couldn't use them for clinical research anymore, so what better time to try my hand?

[Pretty easy to implement with hard wiring](https://imgur.com/a/lUV3mI6)

EQUIPMENT:
* 1x Arduino UNO
* 1x AD8232 ECG module
* 1x package of ECG stickers

TO-DO:
1. Store the ECG signal (SD card?)
2. Look into power options
3. Export ECG data for HRV analysis?
